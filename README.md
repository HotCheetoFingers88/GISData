# GISData
analyze the relationship between public health outcomes and air quality data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Here's a sample README template for your GIS data analysis project. You can customize it further based on your specific needs and audience.


## Features
- Data Loading:** Import health and air quality data.
- Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values in health data.
- Spatial Analysis:** Create feature classes, perform kernel density estimation, and conduct spatial joins.
- Buffer Analysis:** Generate buffers around health hotspots for further assessment.
- Heatmap Visualization:** Create and save visual representations of health hotspot density.
- *Predictive Modeling:** Build a Random Forest model to predict health outcomes based on air quality data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ArcPy (ArcGIS)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Access to ArcGIS software

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the script with the required command-line arguments:

```bash
python your_script.py --workspace <path_to_workspace> --health_data <path_to_health_data.csv> --air_quality_data <path_to_air_quality_shapefile> --mxd_path <path_to_mxd_file>
```

### Arguments

- `--workspace`: Path to the ArcGIS workspace.
- `--health_data`: Path to the health data CSV file.
- `--air_quality_data`: Path to the air quality shapefile.
- `--mxd_path`: Path to the ArcGIS MXD file.

## Logging

The script utilizes the Python `logging` library to track the process and log any warnings or errors encountered during execution. Logs will be printed to the console.

## Output

- Heatmap of health hotspots density saved as `heatmap.png`.
- PDF map of the analysis saved in the specified directory.
- Mean Squared Error of the predictive model logged in the console.
